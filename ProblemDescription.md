# Project Description
This mechatronic design team aims to design an autonomous armed robot to operate on various existing human-operated electro-mechanical devices on ships. The ShipBot should require no modifications on existing target devices, and it should be easily integrated into the existing ships. Also, some additional design guidelines should consider the operating environment and space inside of common ships to ensure ShipBotâ€™s performance, mobility, stability, and costs. In this proposal, different design areas are discussed.
