7.4 Risk Management
Due to the limited budget, and the high price of several components, like linear actuators and mecanum wheels, components should have reasonable specifications, and certain less important components should be chosen with lower specifications to reduce cost. For linear actuators, only the vertical part needs to generate high torque, so the horizon linear actuator could have a lower torque payload. Also, due to the size of the testing environment and the stroke length of the linear actuator should be lower than the height of the targets. For mecanum wheels, different load capacity would influence the cost, so choosing lower load capacity would reduce the overall cost. Moreover, using existing components from previous teams could also help to reduce components costs and long parts wait time.
The length of the semester also constrains the complexity of the project, while the high degree of custom design and prototyping demands a long time of researching, developing and testing. In the case of severe time constraints, some integration and ideas from previous years teams should be considered to reduce the development time. Existing products could also alleviate the time constraint. Weekly reports and meetings would be crucial to gauge the progress of the development and to make necessary changes.
